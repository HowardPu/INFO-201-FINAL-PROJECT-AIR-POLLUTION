> An **air quality index** (AQI) is a number used by [government agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency) to communicate to the public how [polluted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution) the air currently is or how polluted it is forecast to become. As the AQI increases, an increasingly large percentage of the population is likely to experience increasingly severe adverse health effects. Different countries have their own air quality indices, corresponding to different national air quality standards.
